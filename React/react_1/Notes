/*
-> we can access any attribute like class , id , function by using curly bracket {}
 ex :- 
            function App() {

            let name  = 'react app'
            let className = 'App-header';
           
            return (
               <>
                 <div className={className}>
                     {name}
                   <Demo></Demo>
                 </div>
               <>
            );
          }

-> <> This is Known fragment we use it becuase we do'nt to include one more div or parent div; 

**jSX :-  <Component style = {{color:'red' , backgroundColor:'red'}} />  means

**props :- <Component name = "x" age = {42} />     here  name and age are props;  or -->> function Component({props}) and access by props.name;
         function Component({name , age}){...}   here {name , age} are props or we can use by {props} and access it by props.name and props.age;


*********
children  is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking/rendering a component:
ex:- 
const Picture = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.src}/>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  )

//App.js
render () {
  return (
    <div className='container'>
      <Picture key={picture.id} src={picture.src}>
                 //what is placed here is passed as props.children  
      </Picture>
    </div>
  )
}

** Hooks ->  Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features such as useState , useEffect , useContext;
** useState -> The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application

To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component. :-  import { useState } from "react";
ex:-
          import { useState } from "react";

          function Car() {
            const [car, setCar] = useState({                           //initial value of car properties;
              brand: "Ford",
              model: "Mustang",
              year: "1964",
              color: "red"
            });
            
            const updateColor = () => {
              setCar(previousState => {
                return { ...previousState , color: "blue" }
              });
            }

            return(
              <>
                <h1> My {car.brand} </h1>
                <p> It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}. </p>
                <button type="button" onClick = {updateColor}> Blue </button>
             </>
            )
          }

Because we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our setCar function. This function receives the previous value.
We then return an object, spreading the previousState and overwriting only the color.
 
inital ouput :-    My Ford                                        and when we click            My Ford
                   It is a red Mustang from 1964                  on Blue botton then          It is a blue Mustang from 1964
                   Blue  -> this is button                        ouput will    ----->         Blue
                    
simpler ex :-
              function FavoriteColor() {
                const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

                return (
                  <>
                    <h1> My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
                    <button type = "button"   onClick = {() => setColor("blue")}> Blue </button>                                            
                  </>
                )
              }

initial output :-      My favorite color is red!             when we click                    My favorite color is blue!
                       Blue  -> this is button               on Blue botton then :-           Blue
